Have you ever had a dataset with start and end times for events where you wanted to know how many events were occuring simultaneously a given timestamp? 

This has come up many times for me, both in my professional work as well as in questions on the R4DS slack community, where I am a mentor. I would guess that this is a common data wrangling problem for anyone working with this type of data.

# Motivating Example

Let's create a toy dataset of login and logout times, where we want to know how many users were logged in simultaneously during a given minute.

```{r, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE, echo = TRUE}

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

starting_times <- seq(from = as_datetime("2021-01-01 00:00:00"), 
                      to = as_datetime("2021-01-10 00:00:00"), by = "hour")

ending_times <- seq(from = as_datetime("2021-01-10 00:00:00"), 
                    to = as_datetime("2021-01-20 00:00:00"), by = "hour")

event_data <- tibble(event_num = paste0("session_", seq(1, 100, by = 1)), 
                     login = sample(starting_times, 100), logout =  sample(ending_times, 100))

```

# Generate Datetime Sequence

Now I'll generate a datetime sequence for each login and logout event. The most straightforward way to do this is to map through each start and end time with the seq function.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

library(purrr)

event_data_seq <- event_data %>%
  mutate(dt_sequences = map2(login, logout, seq, by = "hour"))

```

# Expand

The next step is to expand or unnest these datetime sequences into a long format. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}

event_data_expanded <- event_data_seq %>%
  unnest(dt_sequences) %>%
  rename(dt = dt_sequences) %>%
  select(event_num, dt)

event_data_expanded 

```

Great! Now the dt column has all the minutes that each session was active expanded in a tidy format.

# Visualize

Let's see how many concurrent sessions there were over time.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

event_data_expanded %>%
  count(dt) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dt, n)) + 
    geom_col() + labs(title = "How many concurrent sessions were there over time?",
                      x = "Time", y = "count",
                      caption = "@kevin_m_kent") + theme_minimal() 

```

That's it! I'd love to hear what you think and if you have another way of solving this problem.
